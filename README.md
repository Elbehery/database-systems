# Database Systems Resources

## Overview

This repo contains a list of resources that are hopefully useful for people who want to learn more about database systems. Resources include papers, university courses, blog posts, talks, and other sources.

## Courses

The [CMU Database Group](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/) have put video lectures and other resources from two of their courses online. They've even provided Gradescope access for non-CMU students so that you can submit assignments and have them assessed by the autograder.

### CMU 15-445/645 - Introduction to Database Systems

* [Course Website - Fall 2021](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2021/)
* [Video Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjZaHA6QcxDfJ0SIWBzQFKEG)

### CMU 15-721 - Advanced Database Systems

This course covers more advanced topics in database system internals, including in-memory database systems, OLAP systems, etc. 

* [Course Website - Spring 2020](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2020/)
* [Video Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjasmrEd2_Yi1deeE360zv5O)

### MIT 6.830 / 6.814 - Database Systems

MIT has a course on Database Systems available on OpenCourseWare. There's not much there, but there are lecture notes that follow readings from the famous [Red Book](http://www.redbook.io/).

### Cornell - CS 4320

Prof. Immanuel Trummer has put a bunch of great lectures online. These are especially useful if you're reading Database Management Systems by Ramakrishnan et al.
